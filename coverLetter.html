                                During my education at York University, I have acquired a strong financial/accounting background and excellent administrative skills, 
                                allowing me to understand what a business needs to be successful and how to make meaningful contributions to said business. 
                                During my time at George Brown College, I have created various meaningful projects with many different technologies. Through various courses and projects,
                                 I have gained extensive knowledge of Java, JavaScript, HTML, MySQL C# and Python. This program requires several group projects which demands knowledge of 
                                 software development theory and agile development, it has further developed my communication skills
                            </p>

                                In addition to my financial/accounting skills, I have performed several jobs related to customer service, which has helped to enrich my transferable skills. 
                                During my time as an office assistant at SuperFix Auto Service, I learned to accurately and quickly assess customer needs and meet those needs. 
                                While in this position, I developed strong Microsoft Excel skills to enter data into the spreadsheet (later a database) and prepare invoices. At my 
                                current position as a Closing Manager, communication between managers is essential to determine the current state of the store and what tasks need to be 
                                worked on. This information is then communicated to my crew and tasks are appropriately assigned. The switch in my education to a technology field was due 
                                to my strong interest in emerging technologies and the trends they have created
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is my desire to work within an institution that offers a team-oriented environment, which encourages interest in developing essential skills required to excel 
                                in the workplace. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to meeting with you and further discussing my skills and qualifications.
