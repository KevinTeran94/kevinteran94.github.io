                                Regarding the task L, the team has decided to cut the quiz module out of the project scope. The team believes 
                                we will not have the time to complete the feature. The team is also debating whether to cut the feedback 
                                module and analytics feature out but for now it remains in scope. All dates in the task listing are the current estimates as 
                                decided by the team. March 21 – March 27, 2020 will be used to debug, polish, and finish any remaining 
                                features.
