                            <p>I'm 25 and a recent graduate of the Computer Programmer Analyst Program at George Brown College. I was born and raised in Toronto and I love
                                everything about this city. When I'm not at my desk coding some new project I thought up of I like to go to the gym and play video games. Going to the gym
                                is strangely refereshing to I because it clears my mind and allows me better focus other tasks. Video games, I feel like are a great destresser. They allow you
                                to live out your fantasies in a very convenient way. Huge basketball fan, if I had the time I would watch every basketball game and go to every single raptor
                                game. That's basically me in a nutshell.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                            <p>Many people don't like change but I try to embrace. I like to think that everything is constantly changing so change must be natural. I like to try new
                                food/restaurants, games. activites, and most importantly technology. I feel that if you tie yourself to one technology and ignore what's new out there, you will
                                be left behind. Life is like a river. It has peaks and troughs, pits and swirls, all are part of the ride. Its best to enjoy the ride, as wild as it may be.
                            </p>
