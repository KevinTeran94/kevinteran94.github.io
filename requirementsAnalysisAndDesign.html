                            <h2>Introduction</h2>

                            <p><b>Purpose</b></p>
                            <p>
                                The purpose of this document is to present the high-level software requirements for the Tea subscription box app. The features of the system will be described in detail and various diagrams will be created to ensure the users of this document have the same understanding of the system. The use cases of the system will also be discussed in this document. The intended audiences for this document are the stakeholders and the developers of the app.

                                <li>This app will have a simple, easy to navigate user interface
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>This will keep users engaged with the app and have a positive experience with the app</li>
                                        <li>The app must be simple enough for any stakeholder to use no matter their knowledge of technology</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    App will bridge the gap between customers and tea company
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Instead of having to sell the company’s product through specialty stores/grocery store, product is sold directly to customer </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                </li>

                            <h2>System Overview</h2>

                            <h3>Project Perspective</h3>
                            <p>The Tea subscription box app does not build off any current system and is therefore a new self-contained system as far as the development team is concerned. Whether is replaces an existing system depends on the company’s decision</p>

                            <h3>System Context</h3>
                            <p>The app will address three main strategic issues:</p>
                            <p><b>Attract potential customers directly</b>:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>This will be achieved by the app providing an easy to use interface, direct communication with customers (no middleman i.e., grocery stores, specialty stores)</li>
                                <li>Plenty of information in app about various teas and their brewing methods</li>
                                <li>Many detailed subscription plans to choose from.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><b>Better understanding of the market</b>:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Data gathered by the app will be stored and used to generate relevant analytics</li>
                                <li>Analytics will provide a picture of the current market</li>
                                <li>Managers will be able to access analytics through their admin account</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><b>Management of inventory</b>:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Managers will be able to view inventory and relevant analytics whenever they want through their admin account </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>General Constraints</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The development tool of choice is currently android studio.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>However other mobile framworks are being researched</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The app must be installed onto the customers phone
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The memory requirements must be kept low to not inconvenience the customer with memory worries </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Response time for accessing the application features should be low</li>
                                <li>Customer must be familiar with using the app/play store</li>
                                <li>
                                    A sample database will be designed and used by the team to complete the project
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The implementation of another dataset after the completion of the project will fall on the tea company </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>The company can keep up with increased and changing demand of customers</li>
                                <li>The products offered through the app is limited to the company’s products</li>
                            </ul>


                            <h3>Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>

                            <p>
                                A database designed by the team will be used. The normalized data model diagram in 3.3 has the logical requirements for data formats and their relationships. Currently the required storage capabilities are unknown, but the team predicts it will not be a large amount of required storage. As for data retention, the team has decided that all records must be stored indefinitely to create accurate analytics of products. Ultimately the decision of storage capabilities and data retention will fall on the tea company. All data will be validated before stored in the database to ensure data integrity.
