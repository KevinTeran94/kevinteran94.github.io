                            <p>The team created status reports to keep our instructor updated on the project and to evaluate their own performance. We used it as kind of a health checkup for the project. Below is an example of one of the reports</p>

                            <h3>Project Status Summary</h3>
                            <p>The team has continued to work on the deliverables of the project. We have successfully completed the customer features and thus consider the customer module complete. The team has implemented the navigation to the admin side features and the next step to add functionality to the features. The database is complete and the only adjust it will need is additional methods in the helper class to facilitate admin functionality. The team remains on track to complete the project on time.  </p>
