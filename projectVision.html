                            <p><b>Purpose</b></p>
                            <p>
                                The purpose of this Project Vision Document is to provide an overview to the Tea Subscription Box the team wishes to develop. It will provide 
                                the necessary ideas and details for the team to develop the project and what the organization can expect from the project at the time of completion.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p><b>Scope</b></p>
                            <p>
                                In-scope:The project will include the Front-end User interface that the customer will interact with to mange their profile, leave reviews and select their
                                 subscription plan. The administrator view will be able to view customer profiles, manager inventory and view analytics generated from the data in the
                                 database
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This project will not handle human resources, payroll and the legal part of the company. The company will be responsible to handle the 
                                shipping and handling part of the business.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Positioning</h2>
                            <p><b>Business Opportunity</b></p>
                            <p>
                                There is a lack of an application that can teach customers about the types of teas in the market and allow them to purchase said teas and 
                                tea accessories through a simple to use interface. The organization would also like some analytics based on the customers to better judge 
                                the market and position themselves.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Assumptions</h2>
                            <p>
                                Right now, the project is proposed as a mobile application. However, if the technology is not available or the team finds a better technology 
                                to complete the project with, the application may change to a web application. Since a real company’s database is not readily available, 
                                a sample database will be designed and implemented by the project team. This is the plan going forward unless a stakeholder requires a change.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>Constraints</h2>
                            <p>
                                One of the major design constraints is the use of a sample database. Everything will be based on the team’s sample database and thus it may be 
                                difficult to implement another database later. However, the implementation of another database after the completion of the project will fall on the Tea company.
